  description = """ Research student working in the topics of neural information retrieval systems, with a focus on health domain.
   * As part of my research work, I worked towards the objective of enhancing clinical information retrieval in health forums, and therefore improving patient-centric community QA and browsing experience.
   * Wrote a set of optimal heuristic functions that maximizes the relevancy scores for a labelled dataset by training a snorkel classifier that classifies a given query-document pair as relevant or irrelevant. Later, these functions will be extended to classify the unlabelled set of query-document pairs, followed by re-ranking
   * Additionally I explored neural ranking models, and conducted several experiments for evaluating modern deep IR techniques based on : a. Type of deep matching models - Representation based vs Interatcion based b. Type of matches : Semantic matching vs Relevancy matching c. models that perform reranking in multi-stage ranking architectures vs learned dense representations that attempt to perform ranking directly.
