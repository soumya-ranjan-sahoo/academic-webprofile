Abstact - Successes in natural language processing gave rise to numerous automated essay scoring systems, some of which are now used in high-stakes tests. In this project we take one of the recent models into consideration and through several sanity checks reveal some of its intriguing properties.

**This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning in Cybersecurity course of Saarland University.**
