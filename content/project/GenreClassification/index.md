title: "Music Information Retrieval For Genre Classification"
summary: We implement k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Multi-class SVM, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) to classify the following four genres: Dark-Forest, Hi-Tech, Full-On, and Goa. We further extract 30 temporal features using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Auto-encoder from individual frames, and augment them with the frame-level audio features, which is a novel contribution in this work.
