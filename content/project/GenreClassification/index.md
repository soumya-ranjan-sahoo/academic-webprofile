title: "Music Information Retrieval For Genre Classification"
summary: We implement k nearest neighbors, Gaussian Mixture Model, Multi class SVM, Convolutional Neural Network, and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network to classify the following four genres: DarkForest, Hi-Tech, FullOn, and Goa. We further extract 30 temporal features using a Long Short Term Memory based Auto encoder from individual frames, and augment them with the frame level audio features, which is a novel contribution in this work.

Abstact - Classifying online social media text is more challenging than dealing with normal corpus data due to the use of informal language and non-textual characters. Here we try to analyze different approaches of online tweet classification into offensive and non-offensive categories. We try to enhance the tokenization process to capture better sparsity in our non-textual data. We first attempt to classify tweets using a simple Naive Bayes text classifier. After this, we also try out other advanced text classification approaches on the same data with the aim to get better results. We here try to present a case-study comparing some of such methodologies by analyzing theirpredictions and results.
